The ARM SPECIAL ECMWF DDH archive for the SGP site contains 3*5 files.
The data set has been created especially for the IOP 15.Sep.1997 to
6.Oct.1997 using the ECMWF operational system of mid-1998 (!!!).
One difference is that the data in the data set is available
every model time step (i.e., every 20 minutes) instead of hourly. 
A second difference is that a point close to the central
facility has been included (see area description below). The 
actual file contents is otherwise exactly the same as in the standard
monthly data set we supply.

The files  are 'tared' and compressed into one file named:

ARM_SPECIAL_yymm_sgp.tar.Z


There are three domains over which all the quantities are averaged.
They are numbered 1,2,3. Domain 2 is equivalent to domain 29
in the ordinary ARM data set, domain 3 to domain 28.

The point/areas for the domains are:

1: 262.67,36.22
2: 261.7,37.,263.,36.
3: 260.3,38.8,264.6,34.8


For each of the domains there are 5 files per month:

*_var_*
*_flx_*
*_ten_*
*_sfc_*
*_sfce_*

Every day of data starts with a header (first 3 lines). The first line
explains the second. The first for parameters on the second line are
model internal parameters and are irrelevant for the user. The next four
numbers mark the corners of the area over which the data was averaged
(note that the model resolution is about 0.56x0.56 degrees). The third
line has the headers for the columns which follow. 'idat' and 'itime' are
the initial date and time of the forecast from which the data was 
retrieved.'vdate' and 'vtime' are the verifying date and time of the
data meaning date and time which it is valid for. Hence the difference
to the initial date and time indicates the forecast range used. The next
column ('lev') is the model level of the data followed by the data
itself, which varies from file to file (see below). The pressure of each
of the model levels can be retrieved from the *var* file, where it is
stored in the first data column.

The contents of the individual files is the following:

*_var_*

These files contain the model variables on the 31 model levels. Level 1
is the top full level of the model (10 hPa), level 31 is the lowest 
full level.

The order of the variables is:

p - pressure (Pa)
u - zonal wind component (m/s)
v - meridional wind component (m/s)
T - temperature (K)
q - specific humidity (kg/kg)
l - specific cloud liquid water content (kg/kg)
i - specific cloud ice content (kg/kg)
a - cloud fraction (percent/100.)
R - reative humidity (percent/100.)
w - omega=vertical velocity in pressure coordinates (Pa/s)

*_flx_*

These files contain the radiative fluxes throughout the atmosphere.
The fluxes are averages over the last hour.

They are archived on the 32 so called flux levels of the model
(often referred to as half-levels). The full levels on which the variables
are stored are placed between two flux levels. Hence, level 32 represents
the surface and level 1 the top of the atmosphere. Full level k is between
half level k and k+1.

The order of the fluxes is:

fswr - net shortwave flux (W/m2)
flwr - net longwave flux (W/m2)

*_ten_*

These files contain the total and physical tendencies for u,v,T and q on
the 31 model levels. The units are as above per second.

The order of the tendencies is:

u total
u physics
v total
v physics
T total
T physics
q total
q physics

*_sfc_*

These files contain surface variables and fluxes. The level number is set
to 1.

The order is:

soil temperature in layer 1 (7 cm deep) (K)
shortwave radiation (W/m2)
longwave radiation (W/m2)
latent heat flux over water (W/m2)
latent heat flux over ice/snow (W/m2)
sensible heat flux (W/m2)
ground heat flux between layer 1 and layers 2/3/4 (W/m2)
soil moisture in layer 1 (m3/m3)
large-scale rain (mm/s)
convective rain (mm/s)
large-scale snow (mm/s)
convective snow (mm/s)
surface pressure (Pa)

*_sfce_*

These files contain extra near surface and surface variables in the
following order:

2m Temperature (K)
2m specific humidity (kg/kg)
10m wind u-component (m/s)
10m wind v-component (m/s)
skin temperature (K)
albedo
downward surface solar radiation (W/m2)
downward surface longwave radiation (W/m2)

Note:

Very small (.lt.1.E-10 for precipitation and .lt. 1.E-1 for radiation)
and small negative numbers in solar radiation and precipitation are 
due to packing and unpacking mechanisms and do not represent 
model problems !
