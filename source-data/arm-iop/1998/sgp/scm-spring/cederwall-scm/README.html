<h1 align="center">Spring 1998 Single Column Model (SCM) IOP</h1>

<p>Seasonal SCM IOPs are conducted at the Southern Great Plains to enhance 
the frequency of observations for SCM uses, particularly vertical soundings 
of temperature, water vapor, and winds. The SCM IOPs are conducted for a 
period of 21 days.  During that time, radiosondes are launched at the Central 
Facility and the four boundary facilities eight times per day, seven days
per week. The data are required for quantifying boundary forcing and column 
response.</p>

<p>Model results are available for the Spring 1998 SCM IOP. </p> 

<p>Description:</p>

<p>Analysis for the ARM April 1998 IOP data:  The analysis is based on the
variational method described in Zhang and Lin (1997) and Zhang et al.  (2001).
For this particular analysis, the implementation version 2 (IV-2) of the 
method was used.  This version inherits all of the features of IV-1 (used
to process the ARM July 95 IOP) listed immediately below, and it also 
includes the features new in IV-2, which are listed afterwards. </p>

<p>(1) Hourly wind data from 17 profilers surrounding the ARM CART array have 
been used as additional input.  </p>

<p>(2) A scale-controlled statistical interpolation procedure similar to 
Ooyama (1987) has been implemented in our pre-processing step. </p>

<p>(3) Radar rainfall (4 by 4 km cells) have been used in the calculation of
area-averaged precipitation estimation.</p>

<p>(4) All upper-air data have been smoothed by using a three-point running mean
in time as an attempt to de-aliase unresolvable features. </p>

<p>(5) The error variance functions in the variational procedures vary with height
according to estimation of both instrument and sampling uncertainties.</p>

<p>(6) More rigorous quality control procedures have been implemented to screen 
raw sounding and profiler data.</p>

<p>(7) All constraint variables are derived by first gridding them and then
taking the area average.  Measurements from a variety of platforms (SMOS,
EBBR, SONDES, Ok Mesonet, Kansan Mesonet, ...) are merged to produce the
gridded surface composites. Latent and sensible heat fluxes are obtained
from the EBBR stations</p>


<p>Implementation features new in IV-2 are:</p>

<p>1.   all surface and TOA constraint variables are averaged to three hours
centered at the 3-hourly sounding time with no other time filtering.  In the
previous version, there was additional time filtering in the constraint surface
and TOA variables.</p>

<p>2.   Surface lower boundary condition of omega is used to form the column
integrated budgets of moisture and energy.  These are provided in the
single-level data file.  The previous version used rigid boundary surface
boundary condition in forcing the column budgets.</p>

<p>3.   Surface radiation measurements from the network of SIROS stations have
 been used to merge with the net radiation from EBBR stations to derive the 
area-mean surface radiation.  The SIROS longwave and shortwave upward and 
downward radiative fluxes have been added to the single-level data file.</p>

<p>4.   Surface latent and sensible heat fluxes from the ECOR network have been
used to merge those from the EBBR network to derive the area-averaged surface
latent and sensible heat fluxes.  In the previous version, only EBBR stations
are used.</p>

<p>5.   Several interpolation routines have been modified.  In particular, time
interpolation of missing data is avoided as much as possible to account for the
large daily and diurnal variability of several quantities.</p>

<p>6.   Temperature, geopotential height, and dry static energy are re-balanced
hydrostatically in each step of the variational routine.  This has been found 
to improve consistencies of the temperature and dry static energy advections.</p>

<p>**Note: regular sounding data was used in this IOP.</p>

<p>There are two fortran source code files to read the data (for single-level
fields and for multi-layer fields).   Everything is self-explained in the
source files.  A list of the single-level fields and multi-layer fields in
the data files is attached here.  I have included  fields in addition to
those for running SCMs in the data files for your diagnostic purpose.
More detailed information about the variational analysis method can be found 
in Zhang and Lin (1997) and Zhang et al. (2001)</p>
