Data content:
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Model forcing data sets, for the CPM Working Group, 
produced using the Constrained Variational Analysis method,
each being pertinent to a separate ARM IOP, conducted at SGP.

Each data set was produced -- using 
the ARM IOP 3-hourly sounding data (supplemented with RUC-2 
analysis samples and NOAA wind profiler data) as the vertical
atmospheric data, which were constrained with  
the ARM ground surface measurements and 
the NOAA GOES-8 satellite data.    


Directory structure: (file names & description)  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
(Files are listed below in an order suited to their explanation, which
differs from the order you actually see them listed in the directory.)

Note: yyyy or yy = year
      mm = month
      dd = day

IOPforcing_VarAna.doc -- MS/Word document for the Constrained 
		      Variational method as applied to IOP data; 
layer_rd_anymon.for   -- Fortran code for reading text-formatted file
		      named layer_<yymm>.dat 
		      (for any data set -- IOP or precise month); 
surface_rd_anymon.for -- Fortran code for reading text-formatted file
		      named surface_<yymm>.dat 
		      (for any data set -- IOP or precise month).

layer_yymm.dat           -- text-formatted data file containing 
			time-height (2-D) variables; 
surface_yymm.dat         -- text-formatted data file containing
			time-series (1-D) variables.
Dsgp3hIOPsndgBasedV2.0_ConstrVarAnaX1.c1.yyyymmdd.000000.cdf
		     -- all variables in one netCDF file.
